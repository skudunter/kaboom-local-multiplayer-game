# kaboom-local-multiplayer-game

A local multiplayer game created using [kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/)ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨.   
Featuring two robots who can shoot eachotherðŸ¤–.   
(the game is very scuffed)

## Note
Due to lazy programming the game is not responsive so you will need my Dell monitor to see the game correctly.   
***(Neither the art nor SFX are mine)***
